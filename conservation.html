						<h2>A CASE FOR INDIGENOUS APPROACHES TO CONSERVATION, COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT, AND DE-GROWTH</h2>
						
						<hr />
						
						<p>Dr. Ravikumar’s work critically examines alternative approaches to Amazonian forest conservation, with a focus on the 
						historical impact of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs on Indigenous communities who have stewarded tropical 
						forests for centuries. While PES programs are often praised for their neoliberal economic framework, they are not primarily 
						designed to foster conservatio--desentivizing deforestation is not synonimous to conservation. Instead, their focus on 
						economic growth often undermines Indigenous institutions, self-determination, and quality of life. The publication I 
						contributed to, "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800922003846"><i>How Payments for Ecosystem 
						Services Can Undermine Indigenous Institutions: The Case of Peru's Ampiyacu-Apayacu Watershed</i></a>," argues that conservation 
						policies grounded in de-growth principles and Indigenous well-being offer more sustainable, empowering solutions.</p>

						<h3>Abstract</h3> 
						<p>Payments for ecosystem services have come to dominate international policies for addressing tropical deforestation. 
						Political ecologists, degrowth scholars, and Indigenous activists have critiqued these approaches on the grounds that by 
						centering economic growth, they can disrupt local conservation systems and compromise forest-dwelling communities' ability to 
						protect forests and live well. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups have developed positive alternatives to ‘green growth’ strategies, 
						including <i>buen vivir</i> (good living) in Latin America. In Peru, the National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) serves as the 
						state's flagship initiative to address tropical deforestation in Indigenous communities by paying communities for demonstrated 
						reductions in deforestation, so long as they invest those funds according to an agreed upon management plan. We analyzed how 
						the NFCP has interacted with quality-of-life plans, Indigenous planning tools rooted in buen vivir. Our findings suggest that 
						the NFCP has eroded local systems for conservation, including the minga, an Amazonian tradition of mutual aid and shared labor 
						for subsistence livelihoods, pushing communities to replace these systems with commodity production and employer-employee 
						relationships. We argue that instead of imposing onerous conditions and steering communities towards evermore commodity 
						production, conservation initiatives should support the implementation of quality-of-life plans. We suggest that climate 
						justice organizers, political ecologists, and degrowth scholars explore and advocate for such initiatives.</p>

						<h3>Contributions and Takeaways</h3>
						<p>As a research assistant on this project, I had two primary roles. First, I conducted comprehensive literature reviews of PES 
						programs, ensuring that the sources I selected represented diverse perspectives. I also translated primary documents and 
						interviews from Spanish to English. Most of my work was completed remotely during the summer of 2020, and I contributed to 
						late-stage editing and read-throughs of the manuscript.
						</br>
						Having taken several classes with Professor Ravikumar prior to joining this project, I credit him as a transformative mentor. 
						His teachings broadened my worldview, deepened my commitment to community engagement, and sharpened my critical thinking. Rather 
						than asking us to “solve” global issues, he encouraged us to listen to those on the frontlines—communities that have already 
						developed grassroots solutions. His approach reinforced my belief in intersectionality within research and the importance of 
						contributing knowledge and privilege without overshadowing other voices, lessons for which I will always be grateful.</p>
