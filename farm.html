						<h2><b>STUDENT FARMER</b>
						</br>
						<i>BOOK&amp;PLOW FARM / AMHERST COLLEGE</i></h2>
						
						<hr />
						
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/andrea_farm.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
						In the spring of 2022, I worked as a student farmer at Book & Plow Farm, focusing on preparing and planting fall crops. 
						My tasks included seeding, potting, and planting a variety of vegetables like peppers, Brussels sprouts, kale, potatoes, 
						and onions, as well as preparing fields for cover crops such as mustard. Late in the season, I assisted in harvesting kale 
						and cilantro. I also collected soil samples for laboratory analysis and was responsible for greenhouse maintenance, which 
						involved watering, monitoring plant health, and maintaining environmental controls to ensure optimal growing conditions.
						</br>
						</br>
						Beyond crop management, I contributed to several farm development projects. These included preparing a raised bed for herbs 
						and medicinal plants, helping devise a design that would prevent poison ivy encroachment. I also helped dismantle an old 
						greenhouse and prepare the land for a new structure. One of my major contributions was clearing a large area overrun with 
						invasive species like buckthorn and multiflora rose, making way for a new field plot.
						</br>
						</br>
						A key aspect of Book&amp;Plow’s mission is educational outreach, and I assisted in leading classes that introduced sustainable 
						farming practices to students. I guided class activities and supported the integration of farm-based learning into academic 
						coursework.</p>

						<p>I regret not discovering the opportunity to work at the farm earlier in my undergraduate career. The hands-on work in farm 
						management and sustainable agriculture felt deeply practical and engaging, allowing me to directly apply what I was learning 
						instead of viewing it as abstract or conceptual. It was eye-opening to see the barriers farmers face when trying to implement 
						organic or regenerative practices and obtain certification. This experience also reshaped my understanding of how farms interact 
						with and contribute to their communities—both ecologically and socially—emphasizing the importance of mutual support between a 
						farm and its surrounding environment.</p>
