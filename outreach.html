								<h3>EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH</h3>
								<p>I feel a deep sense of joy every time I hear, “She’s a real-life scientist!” at an outreach event. 
								For much of my life, I didn’t see a future in science as a legitimate possibility for myself. Growing up, 
								the National Geographic documentaries that sparked my love for science didn’t feature people who looked like 
								me or offer much BIPOC representation. Moreover, with limited funding for scientific research in Mexico, it 
								felt like an unrealistic path.
								</br>
								It wasn’t until I encountered teachers, mentors, and professors who made science feel accessible that I began 
								to find certainty in my career path. I can still recall specific individuals who nurtured my curiosity, encouraged 
								my learning, and shaped the scientist I am today. I hope to have that same impact on at least one person. Outreach 
								is incredibly fulfilling, not only because I get to share my passion, but because of the mutual exchange—more often than not, 
								I find that I learn more than, or as much as, I teach.</p>

								<h3><i>Interactive Fish Diet Analysis Activity</i></h3>
								<p>I originally designed this activity for a science convention aimed at children from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. 
								As a volunteer hosting an "activity booth," I wanted to create something highly interactive, adaptable to different age groups, 
								and reflective of my work.
								</br>
								The activity features paper Pacific cod that can be "stuffed" with cut-out prey items in various stages of digestion. These 
								prey include benthic invertebrates, crab, and fish—some whole, others in parts (such as bones, jaws, claws, setae, otoliths), 
								mimicking the types of remains we commonly find in actual stomach samples. Children spread the "stomach contents" on a table and 
								use a mock key I developed to identify the prey, then record their data and measurements. I wrap up the activity by inviting students 
								to share why they think this kind of work is important, allowing space for questions or reflections. For toddlers, the activity can 
								be a simple matching game, while for older students, it incorporates math and critical thinking.
								</br>
								Facilitating this activity at conventions, school science nights, class sessions, and fairs has sharpened my science communication 
								skills. As an educator in these settings, it’s my responsibility to ensure the activity is both engaging and educational for a diverse 
								audience. I’ve found that the more I understand each child’s unique needs, the more deeply they are able to engage with the activity.</p>

								<h3><i>Students Explore Aquatic Sciences (SEAS)</i></h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SEAS.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am an active member of 
								<a href="https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/">SEAS</a>, 
								a volunteer-run outreach program at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery 
								Sciences. The primary mission of SEAS is to increase access to science education for K-12 students from underserved communities in the 
								Seattle area. We organize and lead various project-based and interactive learning opportunities at no cost to participants, including an 
								annual “Open House” with numerous activity booths.
								</br>
								In my role, I’ve led several classroom lessons, primarily focused on marine ecology and water science. These sessions are typically 
								fast-paced and hands-on, guiding students through three to four interactive activities. Given the volunteer-based nature of SEAS, I often 
								step in on short notice to help. Flexibility is key, and I’m always eager to contribute, schedule permitting.
								</br>
								On several occasions, I’ve led lessons or provided translation in Spanish, particularly when there’s a large Spanish-speaking cohort. 
								There's always a special moment when I announce, in Spanish, that I’m from Mexico and will be translating. Seeing the students' faces light 
								up is incredibly rewarding, especially as we work together to find the right Spanish translations for scientific terms. Despite being fluent 
								in Spanish, many of these concepts are ones I first encountered after moving to the U.S., and I love the collaborative learning experience 
								this creates. I recognize the privilege I had in attending a bilingual school in Mexico, which helped me become fluent in English before 
								I moved.
								</br>
								At school fairs and our annual Open House, I typically host an activity booth offering students the choice between my fish diet analysis 
								activity or a food-web-building exercise. For the food web activity, students arrange large panels of Puget Sound organisms, connected by 
								arrows to illustrate who eats whom. I encourage students to guess predator-prey relationships and the arrow direction with minimal guidance, 
								fostering independent thinking. Afterward, we rework the food web together to ensure accuracy, discussing how size and feeding ecology offer 
								clues about trophic dynamics. I often inquire about the significance of arrow direction, but rarely expect an answer given it’s an advanced 
								concept for their age. A young student once answered that arrows represent “the flow of energy.” This is still one of my favorite memorable 
								moments. 
								</br>
								I’ve also translated materials and posters for other booths at the SEAS Open House and assisted with translating classroom lesson plans 
								and materials for educators who don’t speak Spanish, ensuring all students can engage fully with the material.</p>

								<h3><i>Trophic Interactions Laboratory Outreach</i></h3>
								<p>The Trophic Interactions Laboratory regularly offers tours for a variety of audiences, ranging from the AFSC HR department to 
								groups of students. Over the past year and a half, I have proactively taken the lead in conducting and occasionally organizing 
								these tours. This includes preparing the lab by setting up relevant reference materials from our storage room for display. I also 
								sometimes select samples to demonstrate our stomach scanning procedure, offering a hands-on look at our work.
								</br>
								Last spring, a student who had visited the lab with their science class reached out, expressing interest in shadowing us for their 
								senior project. I volunteered to host the student, coordinating all necessary administrative steps, handling logistics, and guiding 
								them through a typical workweek in the lab. I also ensured they had access to the necessary resources for their project and 
								presentation, both during their time with us and afterward.</p>

						<h3><i>Amherst College Food Recovery Program</i></h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FJA.jpeg" alt="" /></span>In my senior year at Amherst College, I co-chaired the 
						<a href="https://amherst.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/fja">Food Justice Alliance (FJA)</a>,  
						a student-led organization committed to addressing systemic food issues both locally and globally. We worked to identify the college’s 
						contribution to these issues and devised action plans to minimize negative impacts, amplifying the voices of the community rather 
						than prioritizing our own perspectives.
						</br>
						My co-chair and I hosted weekly meetings and maintained regular communication with key stakeholders, including dining hall staff, farm 
						directors, and college administrators. As a farm employee, I often helped coordinate events like harvest days for surplus crops, which 
						we donated to local food banks. We also led an annual fundraising event called “Share the Share” in partnership with the college farm, 
						supporting local food justice organizations.
						</br>
						One of our main concerns during the fall of 2021 was the increasing food waste in the dining hall. After conversations with the head of 
						dining operations left us unsatisfied, I took the initiative to explore alternatives. I reached out to the UMass Amherst Food Recovery 
						Network and, ultimately, collaborated with the Amherst Survival Center to create the 
						<a href="https://amherststudent.com/article/food-justice-alliance-puts-extra-val-food-to-use/">Amherst Food Recovery Program</a>. 
						I worked closely with the <a href="https://amherstsurvival.org/about/">Amherst Survival Center</a> to align food safety requirements, 
						coordinated logistics with the college kitchen, and set up volunteer schedules for food packing and delivery. The program relied on 
						volunteers from the student body and faculty, and my co-chair and I alternated responsibilities for training and overseeing these sessions.
