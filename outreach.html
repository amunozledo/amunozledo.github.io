								<h3>EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH</h3>
								<p>I feel a deep sense of joy every time I hear, “She’s a real-life scientist!” at an outreach event. 
								For much of my life, I didn’t see a future in science as a legitimate possibility for myself. Growing up, 
								the National Geographic documentaries that sparked my love for science didn’t feature people who looked like 
								me or offer much BIPOC representation. Moreover, with limited funding for scientific research in Mexico, it 
								felt like an unrealistic path.
								</br>
								It wasn’t until I encountered teachers, mentors, and professors who made science feel accessible that I began 
								to find certainty in my career path. I can still recall specific individuals who nurtured my curiosity, encouraged 
								my learning, and shaped the scientist I am today. I hope to have that same impact on at least one person. Outreach 
								is incredibly fulfilling, not only because I get to share my passion, but because of the mutual exchange—more often than not, 
								I find that I learn more than, or as much as, I teach.</p>
								</br>
								</br>
								<h3><i>Interactive Fish Diet Analysis Activity</i></h3>
								<p>I originally designed this activity for a science convention aimed at children from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. 
								As a volunteer hosting an "activity booth," I wanted to create something highly interactive, adaptable to different age groups, 
								and reflective of my work.
								</br>
								The activity features paper Pacific cod that can be "stuffed" with cut-out prey items in various stages of digestion. These 
								prey include benthic invertebrates, crab, and fish—some whole, others in parts (such as bones, jaws, claws, setae, otoliths), 
								mimicking the types of remains we commonly find in actual stomach samples. Children spread the "stomach contents" on a table and 
								use a mock key I developed to identify the prey, then record their data and measurements. I wrap up the activity by inviting students 
								to share why they think this kind of work is important, allowing space for questions or reflections. For toddlers, the activity can 
								be a simple matching game, while for older students, it incorporates math and critical thinking.
								</br>
								Facilitating this activity at conventions, school science nights, class sessions, and fairs has sharpened my science communication 
								skills. As an educator in these settings, it’s my responsibility to ensure the activity is both engaging and educational for a diverse 
								audience. I’ve found that the more I understand each child’s unique needs, the more deeply they are able to engage with the activity.</p>
