						<h2><b>RESEARCH ASSISTANT / LABORATORY LEAD</b>

						<i>HEWITT LAB, AMHERST COLLEGE</i></h2>

						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/hewitt_lab.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
						Working in the Hewitt Lab taught me valuable lessons about balancing multiple responsibilities. I quickly realized the importance 
						of setting boundaries and asking for help—especially as I stepped into unfamiliar roles, such as organizing lab operations, 
						training students, and maintaining inventory. I hadn’t previously managed these tasks, but the challenges pushed me to grow. 
						Although I struggled at times, these experiences were crucial in shaping my approach to lab work and team leadership.</p>

						<h3><b>POSITION DETAILS</b></h3>
						</br>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/a_lab_bench.JPEG" alt="" /></span>As a senior in Dr. Rebecca Hewitt’s lab, I 
						managed younger undergraduate's independent projects, trained students in root sample preparation, safe handling for 
						downstream DNA analysis, and mycorrhizal colonization, and assisted with various laboratory maintenance tasks. When Dr. Hewitt 
						took maternity leave, I became the lab's point of contact, overseeing communication and procedures. 
						</br>
						Part of my role also involved working on individual projects in support of Dr. Hewitt's research. I was tasked with developing 
						a database of literature investigating the effects of Arctic warming on rhizosphere processes, collaborating with international 
						researchers and senior scientists. 
						</br>
						Finally, I served as Dr. Hewitt's climate science course laboratory TA for one semester. I was in charge of collecting and 
						processing the data for the lab projects and experiments. I carried out stream health assessments, used pH meters to obtain the 
						pH of both soil and water samples, carried out soil incubations to quantify soil carbon content, and instructed students on 
						taxonomy and how to use dichotomous keys. I held weekly hour-liong office hours and instructed students on scierntific writing 
						and basic statistical analysis techniques.</p>

						<h3><b>TAKEAWAYS</b></h3>
						This experience challenged me to manage my workload, my expectations, and delegate tasks effectively. It shaped my understanding 
						of leadership and collaboration with mentors.I often struggled to find the right balance, but the challenges taught me the 
						importance of knowing my limits, setting expectations, and communicating transparently. I have since learned to focus on 
						fewer tasks with more precision. My ability to lead and support others in field, academic, and laboratory settings has also 
						improved significantly.</p>
