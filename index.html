									<p>I was five years old when I first declared I would grow up to be a researcher.
									While the earliest iteration of this dream was to become an herpetologist, my 
									passion for ecology has taken many forms over the past two decades.  My work has 
									also expanded into social science, reflecting my commitment to interdisciplinarity 
									as a core aspect of my research identity. My involvement in a wide range of 
									experiences has deepened my understanding of ecological interconnectedness and 
									solidified my dedication to agroecology and soil science.</p>

								<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
								<p>I feel fortunate to have had access to diverse, formative research opportunities 
								as an undergraduate, working with various PIs and taking on different levels of 
								responsibility and independence. These experiences primarily strengthened my skills in 
								hypothesis development and research design. Since graduating, I have continued to 
								actively seek out extracurricular opportunities for small, self-directed research projects. 
								My current work predominantly focuses on data analysis and coding, allowing me to further 
								refine these essential skills. The key projects linked below reflect the integration of my 
								values, passions, curiosity, and versatility.</p>

								<h3>OUTREACH EXPERIENCE</h3>
								<p>My passion for scientific research is deeply connected to knowing that the projects I 
								engage in address the needs of the communities I’m a part of. This commitment to community 
								engagement extends beyond my academic and professional work. Outreach helps me stay grounded 
								and aware of the realities faced by different groups within my community. I also feel a 
								responsibility to use my privilege to help expand access to resources for underserved 
								individuals. Rather than viewing outreach as a form of 'giving,' I see it as an opportunity 
								to learn from others’ experiences. Through my work and research, I strive to better understand 
								how to amplify the voices of those who may not have easy access to certain platforms and spaces.</p>

								<h3>INTERESTS</h3>
								<p>My interest in agricultural socio-ecological dynamics began in my childhood, when I started
								accompanying my dad on work trips around rural Mexico. Growing up in Mexico City, these eye-opening 
								experiences had a profound impact on me. 
								Alongside my passion for research, I also take pride in my non-academic pursuits, including my love 
								for dance, running, visual art, and reading.</p>
