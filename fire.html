						<h2><b>SOUTHERN SIERRA FIELD CREW LEAD-ASSISTANT</b>
						</br>
						<i>UC DAVIS / USFS</i></h2>
						
						<hr />
						
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/seqi_lean.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						In the summer of 2022, I worked as a field ecologist, conducting habitat surveys and collecting data on post-fire ecosystem 
						recovery and insect-induced tree mortality across National Parks, Forests, and Monuments in the Sierra Nevada. Despite being 
						new to fieldwork, I stepped into the Assistant Lead role following an injury to our crew lead, demonstrating adaptability, 
						dedication, and leadership.</p>

						<h3><b>POSITION DETAILS</b></h3>
						</br>
						</br>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/measuring_seqi.JPEG" alt="" /></span>Throughout the season, we surveyed sites across 
						the Southern Sierra Nevada, including Sequoia National Park, Sequoia National Forest, Kings Canyon National Park, Giant Sequoia 
						National Monument, and Inyo National Forest. I assisted in identifying trees and plant species, and collected measurements of 
						forest stand structure (tree density, basal area, canopy cover). I also collected data related to overstory health and 
						seedling/sapling cover. Our work covered over 100 plots in five sequoia groves and three mixed pine stands, allowing me to 
						develop expertise in various measurement instruments and protocols.
						</br>
						</br>
						Teamwork and communication were critical for safety and data accuracy. Our eight day backcountry camping stints involved hiking 
						through rugged, post-wildfire terrain. These off-the-grid conditions refined my wilderness first aid, navigation, and makeshifting 
						skills.
						</br>
						</br>
						As Assistant Lead, I played a significant role in protocol modifications, training team members, managing gear inventory, 
						and data form design. I also coordinated weekly datatransfers to our lead scientists/contacts at UC Davis and the USFS. I often 
						led the crew to and from plots, navigating with Garmin GPS devices and sometimes relying on memory, a compass, and my sense of direction.
						</br>
						</br>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/burnt_seqi.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
						The data we collected contributed to <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4789">studies</a> 
						investigating the impact of fire on giant sequoia groves and post-fire recovery, with the goal of improving our understanding of 
						fire management and enhancing the application of prescribed fire for ecological benefits.</p>
