						<h2>NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND ARCTIC TREELINE MIGRATION</h2>
						
						<hr />
						
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/andrea_thesis_presentation.jpeg" alt="" /></span>This project, completed as 
						part of my undergraduate thesis, investigated nitrogen limitation as a potential constraint on Arctic treeline migration 
						in the Brooks Range in North-Eastern Alaska. The final product, an 80-page document, was comprised of two main components:
						an extensive, writing-focused introduction (a requirement for environmental studies theses), and a classic scientific paper. 
						I began processing samples in the laboratory during the summer before my senior year (2021), and the project culminated in 
						the submission of my thesis and a formal presentation in May 2022.</p>

						<h3>Abstract</h3>
						<p>Rapid climate warming in the Arctic over the last century has resulted in boreal forest advance into tundra, and thus 
						latitudinal migration of arctic treelines. However, rates of treeline movement have not been uniform throughout the Arctic, 
						with some treeline regions remaining stagnant and others retreating, despite steadily rising temperatures. Understanding 
						the drivers of and limits to treeline migration is incredibly important given the implications for the carbon cycle and the 
						Earth’s energy budget.  This thesis explored the belowground response of white spruce trees to varying degrees of nitrogen 
						limitation at the arctic treeline in the Brooks Range, Alaska. An earlier study of the study sites identified declining 
						soil temperature and soil nutrient gradients from west to east. Here, I found greater mycorrhizal colonization of spruce 
						fine roots at the most nitrogen-limited sites in the colder, easternmost region of the Range. I also observed significantly 
						lower foliar δ15N values at those sites compared to foliar N isotopic signatures of trees at the westernmost watershed. Fine 
						root trait analyses revealed a strong resource economic gradient in morphological root traits of spruce trees at the four 
						watersheds. Interestingly, while there was no correlation between root economic strategy and soil nitrogen availability, I 
						did identify a trend towards a relationship between mycorrhizal abundance and fine root morphology. Overall, my results show 
						that white spruce at the treeline in the Brooks Range have complex responses to nutrient limitation that involve an interplay 
						between mycorrhizal fungi and root morphology.</p>

						<h3>Takeaways</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/lab_roots.jpg" alt="" /></span>This research significantly enhanced my technical 
						laboratory and statistical analysis skills. Over the course of the project, 
						I manually processed 74 white spruce fine root samples and used the ecological software program WinRhizo for sample analysis. 
						I was responsible for all aspects of data organization, processing, and analysis, which I conducted using Microsoft Excel and 
						R Studio. The analysis process was extensive, involving meta-data organization, data exploration, and the development of various 
						visualizations, such as Principal Component Analyses, scatterplots, and box plots.
						</br>
						My work required over 1,000 hours of research, particularly because I was new to coding and using R Studio. The precision needed 
						for techniques like the point-intersect method (for measuring mycorrhizal colonization) demanded a high level of attention to 
						detail. Throughout this process, I worked independently, setting my own deadlines and regularly reporting to my thesis advisor, 
						Dr. Rebecca Hewitt, and my thesis committee. The project not only exposed me to a wide range of laboratory procedures but also 
						strengthened my scientific writing and presentation skills, providing invaluable experience in managing an independent research 
						project from start to finish.</p>

						tips per gram of dry mass; tips/g), and specific root surface area (ratio of surface area per gram of dry mass; cm2/g) were all 
						calculated in Excel, using the measurements from WinRhizo and the dry root mass.
