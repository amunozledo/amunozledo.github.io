						<h2>RESEARCH SCIENTIST
						</br>
						<i>TROPHIC INTERACTIONS LABORATORY,  AFSC</i></h2>
						
						<hr />
					
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/lab.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
						I am currently a research scientist in the Trophic Interactions Laboratory, part of the Resource Ecology and Ecosystem 
						Modeling group at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. My primary responsibility is processing Alaskan groundfish stomach 
						samples and conducting thorough stomach content analyses. Given our broad taxonomic knowledge of Alaskan marine organisms, 
						we also assist with various ID projects for other teams and serve as an identification resource for the Center. Each summer, 
						I participate in the RACE Groundfish Bottom-Trawl Surveys, performing at-sea stomach scans and collecting samples.</p>
					</div>

						<h3><b>PROJECTS</b></h3>
						</br>
						<h3><i>Laboratory Groundfish Stomach Scans</i></h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tummies.JPEG" alt="" /></span>Our laboratory processes approximately 20,000 
						stomach samples annually. Last year I alone conducted around 3,000 scans. 
						Each scan involves accurately identifying all prey items down to the lowest possible taxonomic level. I record critical data, 
						including total stomach content weight, individual prey weights, fish standard lengths, commercially significant crab carapace 
						lengths, predator information, life history stages, and stomach fullness. This data contributes to 
						<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/groundfish-diet-data-description">NOAA’s Groundfish Trophic 
						Interactions Database</a>, which is used for fish bioenergetics modeling, ecosystem monitoring, and food web modeling. Given the 
						importance of this data for broader ecological studies, the lab upholds rigorous accuracy standards, with each identification 
						needing to be 100% correct.
						</br>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/shrimp.JPEG" alt="" /></span>Each year we analyze stomach samples from 
						approximately 10 Alaskan groundfish species. The primary species of interest include 
						Pacific cod (<i>Gadus macrocephalus</i>), walleye pollock (<i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i>), Pacific halibut (<i>Hippoglossus stenolepis</i>), 
						and arrowtooth flounder (<i>Atheresthes stomias</i>). These species exhibit a wide range of dietary preferences, requiring 
						familiarity with over 100 marine organisms native to the North Pacific. The identification process demands a meticulous, 
						detail-oriented approach as prey items often include highly degraded or partial remains. To ensure high data quality, I often 
						cross-reference a variety of taxonomic keys and morphology-based references. I maintain a flexible and open-minded approach, 
						collaborating with my colleagues to resolve any challenging identifications. Since I did not have previous experience with marine 
						organisms before this role, developing my identification skills required persistence, openness to learning, and humility.
						</br>
						In addition to the taxonomic work, I help handle the chemical processes associated with sample preparation. Samples collected 
						at sea are preserved in a 10% formalin solution, and I am responsible for rinsing these samples to remove any traces of 
						formaldehyde and transfer them to a 75% ethanol solution for long-term storage. This process requires neutralizing the formalin 
						and safely disposing of the waste in accordance with AFSC and OSHA standards. These tasks have sharpened my attention to detail 
						in chemical handling and reinforced the importance of adhering to safety protocols in a laboratory setting.
						</br>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/A_respirator.JPEG" alt="" /></span>I also help oversee safety measures within the lab, 
						including regular inspections of equipment such as eyewash stations, ensuring 
						the wet lab is clean and organized, and confirming that all ethanol-preserved samples are securely stored in flammable materials 
						cabinets. This role has not only strengthened my technical skills but also instilled a commitment to fostering a safe and 
						collaborative working environment for my colleagues.
						</br>
						</br></p>
						<hr />
						<h3><i>Seabird Bill Load Analyses</i></h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/red_irish_lord.JPEG" alt="" /></span>Annually, our lab assists the 
						Auke Bay Labs Center with seabird diet analyses, processing around 500 bill load samples. This 
						project involves identifying cephalopods and fish (often in larval stages) and collaborating with other teams to ensure accurate 
						data collection, requiring familiarity with specialized guides and data entry forms.
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						</br></p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Field Participation</h3>
						<p><span class="image left alt"><img src="images/A_boat.JPEG" alt="" /></span>As part of the RACE Bottom-Trawl Groundfish Surveys, 
						I spend roughly a month at sea on NOAA-chartered vessels, working alongside
						a team of scientists and fishermen. Each leg involves conducting 5–6 hauls per day, with catch sizes ranging from 1 to 14 tons. My 
						primary role is performing stomach scans on selected species, completing approximately 700 scans per leg. In addition to sorting 
						fish and invertebrates by species, I participate in biological data collection, which includes sexing fish, measuring fish standard 
						lengths, and collecting otoliths for age determination. I also assist in calibrating and deploying environmental instruments, 
						including temperature, depth, and pressure probes.
						</br>
						These field experiences have sharpened my ability to work efficiently under challenging conditions and have enhanced my teamwork 
						and leadership skills, especially in fostering a collaborative, positive, psychologically safe environment aboard the vessel.</p>
						
						<hr />
						<h3>Training and Educational Contributions</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/andrea_stomach.JPEG" alt="" /></span>I have helped develop training materials for RACE 
						survey stomach collectors and observers, including instructional videos demonstrating collection procedures.

						<h3>SAFS INVOLVEMENT</h3>
						<p>Because of the nature of my position at NOAA, I am affiliated with the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and 
						Fishery Sciences (SAFS). I attend weekly lab meetings hosted by Dr. Tim Essington and regularly participate in discussions on data 
						analysis and research progress. I also attend weekly Fisheries Seminars, which provide opportunities for networking and engagement 
						with the SAFS community.</p>

						<h3>RECOGNITION</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/A_award.JPEG" alt="" /></span>I was the recipient of the Staff Member of the 
						Quarter Award for Q3 of fiscal year 2024.
