							<h2><b>RESEARCH SCIENTIST</b>
							</br>
							<i>TROPHIC INTERACTIONS LABORATORY,  AFSC</i></h2>
						
							<hr />
					
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/lab.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
							I am currently a research scientist in the Trophic Interactions Laboratory, part of the Resource Ecology and Ecosystem 
							Modeling group at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. My primary responsibility is processing Alaskan groundfish stomach 
							samples and conducting thorough stomach content analyses. Given our broad taxonomic knowledge of Alaskan marine organisms, 
							we also assist with various ID projects for other teams and serve as an identification resource for the Center. Each summer, 
							I participate in the RACE Groundfish Bottom-Trawl Surveys, performing at-sea stomach scans and collecting samples.</p>
					</div>

							<h3><b>PROJECTS</b></h3>
							</br>
							<h3><i>Laboratory Groundfish Stomach Scans</i></h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tummies.JPEG" alt="" /></span>Our laboratory processes approximately 20,000 
							stomach samples annually. Last year I alone conducted around 3,000 scans. 
							Each scan involves accurately identifying all prey items down to the lowest possible taxonomic level. I record critical data, 
							including total stomach content weight, individual prey weights, fish standard lengths, commercially significant crab carapace 
							lengths, predator information, life history stages, and stomach fullness. This data contributes to 
							<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/groundfish-diet-data-description">NOAA’s Groundfish Trophic 
							Interactions Database</a>, which is used for fish bioenergetics modeling, ecosystem monitoring, and food web modeling. Given the 
							importance of this data for broader ecological studies, the lab upholds rigorous accuracy standards, with each identification 
							needing to be 100% correct. During the fall of 2023, I helped train a new temporary lab member. They had no prior experience with 
							Alaskan marine organisms, and limited taxonomic identification knowledge.
							</br>
							</br>
							Each year we analyze stomach samples from approximately 10 Alaskan groundfish species. The primary species of interest include 
							Pacific cod (<i>Gadus macrocephalus</i>), walleye pollock (<i>Gadus chalcogrammus</i>), Pacific halibut (<i>Hippoglossus stenolepis</i>), 
							and arrowtooth flounder (<i>Atheresthes stomias</i>). <span class="image right"><img src="images/shrimp.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
							These species exhibit a wide range of dietary preferences, requiring familiarity with over 100 marine organisms native to the 
							North Pacific. The identification process demands a meticulous, detail-oriented approach as prey items often include highly 
							degraded or partial remains. To ensure high data quality, I often cross-reference a variety of taxonomic keys and morphology-based references. 
							I maintain a flexible and open-minded approach, collaborating with my colleagues to resolve any challenging identifications. 
							Since I did not have previous experience with marine organisms before this role, developing my identification skills required persistence, 
							openness to learning, and humility.
							</br> 
							</br>
							In addition to the taxonomic work, I help handle the chemical processes associated with sample preparation. Samples collected 
							at sea are preserved in a 10% formalin solution, and I am responsible for rinsing these samples to remove any traces of 
							formaldehyde and transfer them to a 75% ethanol solution for long-term storage.
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/A_respirator.JPEG" alt="" /></span> This process requires neutralizing the formalin 
							and safely disposing of the waste in accordance with AFSC and OSHA standards. These tasks have sharpened my attention to detail 
							in chemical handling and reinforced the importance of adhering to safety protocols in a laboratory setting.
							</br>
							I also help oversee safety measures within the lab, including regular inspections of equipment such as eyewash stations, ensuring 
							the wet lab is clean and organized, and confirming that all ethanol-preserved samples are securely stored in flammable materials 
							cabinets. This role has not only strengthened my technical skills but also instilled a commitment to fostering a safe and 
							collaborative working environment for my colleagues.

							<h3><i>Seabird Bill Load Analyses</i></h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/red_irish_lord.JPEG" alt="" /></span>Annually, our lab assists the 
							Auke Bay Labs Center with seabird diet analyses, processing around 500 bill load samples. This 
							project involves identifying cephalopods and fish (often in larval stages) and collaborating with other teams to ensure accurate 
							data collection, requiring familiarity with specialized guides and data entry forms.

							<h3><i>Field Participation</i></h3>
							<p><span class="image left alt"><img src="images/A_boat.JPEG" alt="" /></span>As part of the RACE Bottom-Trawl Groundfish Surveys, 
							I spend roughly a month at sea on NOAA-chartered vessels, working alongside
							a team of scientists and fishermen. Each leg involves conducting 5–6 hauls per day, with catch sizes ranging from 1 to 14 tons. My 
							primary role is performing stomach scans on selected species, completing approximately 700 scans per leg. In addition to sorting 
							fish and invertebrates by species, I participate in biological data collection, which includes sexing fish, measuring fish standard 
							lengths, and collecting otoliths for age determination. I also assist in calibrating and deploying environmental instruments, 
							including temperature, depth, and pressure probes.
							</br>
							These field experiences have sharpened my ability to work efficiently under challenging conditions and have enhanced my teamwork 
							and leadership skills, especially in fostering a collaborative, positive, psychologically safe environment aboard the vessel.

							<i>"Andrea works in the REEM trophic interactions laboratory. She excels at her daily job duties in the lab, always 
							putting forth extra effort to complete assigned tasks promptly and successfully. She is a great team member and always 
							has a positive attitude. In addition to her normal duties, she has taken the lead with several outreach activities. She 
							has led tours of our lab for several groups of visiting students. She hosted a high school student who wanted to job shadow 
							a scientist in our lab. She also organizes and presents science activities for children of all ages at different schools 
							and events in the local area. Andrea also took the lead on giving hands on demonstrations during field season training 
							for stomach collections. Andrea is reliable, dependable, and a great member of our team, and I believe she should be 
							recognized for it."</i>

							<h3><b>SAFS INVOLVEMENT</b></h3>
							</br>
							<p>Because of the nature of my position at NOAA, I am affiliated with the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and 
							Fishery Sciences (SAFS). I attend weekly lab meetings hosted by Dr. Tim Essington and regularly participate in discussions on data 
							analysis and research progress. I also attend weekly Fisheries Seminars, which provide opportunities for networking and engagement 
							with the SAFS community.</p>
