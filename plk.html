						<h2>POLLOCK BIOENERGETICS (<i>IN PROGRESS</i>)</h2>
						
						<hr />
						
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/andrea_pollock.JPEG" alt="" /></span>This project investigates 
						the feasibility of using walleye pollock diet data collected by fisheries observers between 
						1985 and 2008 to examine the potential effect of seasonality on foraging success. Most of the Bering Sea stomach samples 
						analyzed by the Trophic Interactions Lab come from summer RACE Bottom Trawl Surveys. Once processed, these data are 
						incorporated into food web and bioenergetic models managed by the Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling group at the 
						Alaska Fisheries Science Center. As a result, these models largely reflect summer feeding ecology—a period when Alaskan 
						groundfish, including pollock, typically consume more prey.
						</br>
						In collaboration with Dr. Kirstin Holsman, I aim to explore the effects of seasonal shifts—such as spawning events or prey 
						population changes following algal blooms—on pollock’s relative foraging rate (RFR), which is the ratio of observed consumption 
						to maximum potential consumption.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Research Question</h3>
						<p>I am currently investigating whether the observer dataset can be used to assess seasonal effects on Southeastern Bering 
						Sea walleye pollock RFR. Observer collections are oportunistic, therefore, the data reflects inconsistent sampling, with high 
						variability in sample numbers across seasons, months, years, and locations. Before I can further explore potential seasonal 
						trends, I have to determine whether that task is feasible with the available data.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Project Status</h3>
						<p>This project is ongoing, and much of the initial work has focused on data exploration and model development. I received a 
						raw version of the dataset and spent time familiarizing myself with its structure, the sampling methodologies, and the types of 
						information captured. In addition to data exploration, I conducted preliminary visual analyses of seasonal diet composition changes. 
						I also reviewed relevant literature on Arctic fish bioenergetics, extracted key variables from various databases, and reorganized the 
						dataset. 
						</br>
						Currently, I’m developing generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify trends that may reflect true seasonal effects, distinguishing 
						them from noise or sampling inconsistencies.</p>
						
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<p>I initiated this independent project to further develop my coding and biostatistics skills, areas where I had little formal 
						training. Although pollock bioenergetics is not my primary research focus, I am deeply engaged with the lab’s work and fascinated by 
						the complexity of marine ecosystems. This project allows me to follow the journey of data from field collection to its use in fisheries 
						management—a process I am passionate about, particularly as it involves understanding ecological dynamics across seasons and years.</p>
